          <h1> Mad Max: Fury Road - stupidist movie ever or god-tier action film? </h1>
          <h3> 7 May 2024</h3>
          <p class="description">
            I once heard someone on a podcast compare “Mad Max: Fury Road” to the later “Fast & Furious” movies. Both were characterized as over-the-top action sequences where spectacle is prioritized over substance - a concoction that caters to the adolescent male. While I agree that Fury Road is simple in many ways (linear story line, barely-there dialogue, unwavering intensity), it’s not the overindulgent, demolition derby/WWE mash-up that it appears to be. Fury Road is the culmination of visual and creative storytelling, an imaginative twist on a post-apocalyptic world, nuanced character development, and pure ridiculousness counterbalanced by subtle detail.

            We’re given an unflinching exploration of a resource-scarce, grim society where the remnants of civilization are repurposed and recycled in a way that blurs recognizable and unrecognizable. My favorite example of this is the wordplay found in the post-apocalyptic jargon - like when Nux laments he should be “McFeasting with the heroes of all time” and when Immortan Joe refers to water as “aqua cola” - I chuckle every time. As the audience, we are accustomed to associating these with McDonald’s and Coca-cola but it’s disorienting to hear how the remnants of corporations and consumerism that have telephone-gamed through time and taken out of context.

            But this world is more than an echo of our own. Rusty spikes on civilian cars, chrome paint, pole cats, and of course, the flaming guitar guy - customizations to reflect this society’s interpretation of warfare and combat and the nearly inhabitable desert in which they survive.

            Despite the lack of exposition, each character undergoes a profound character arc caused by the interactions with one another. At the beginning, Max’s primary objective is to escape and survive, but the circumstances force him to work with Furiosa for mutual survival. Over time, his empathy and sense of responsibility builds which leads him to shift his priorities and assist in their redemption. Once Furiosa’s story concludes, he goes back to square 1 as a wandering road warrior. Given their alliance and heavy reliance on one another, it’s hard to believe that Furiosa’s initial plan was to do it alone. One pivotal scene in which Furiosa realize’s Max’s relability is when she yells “fool!” after a failed attempt at negotiating a safe passage with the motor bike gang. Max immediately starts the war rig and hands a gun to Furiosa as she slides into the passanger seat - Furiosa’s surprise at Max’s reliability, quick-wittedness, and ability to anticipate solidifies her understanding that she can’t do it alone.

            As for fan-favorite Nux, he undergoes a secondary redemption arc alongside Furiosa’s. He starts off like any war boy—brainwashed to believe that his only purpose is to serve Immortan Joe. By the end, Nux is beyond Immortan Joe. He sacrifices himself to protect the group and ensure their return to The Citadel. His final “witness me” is heartbreaking. While that phrase is repeatedly used throughout the film as as way for the war boys to validate their bravery, Nux’s final “witness me” is a final mark of his transformation into a human being with agency.

            So what did I not like about it? I didn’t care much for Max’s flashbacks; they didn’t really serve the movie and were distracting. I also don’t think his preamble was necessary given that the narrative weight was on Furiosa and Nux. But those were easily overshadowed by the film’s strengths.

            The key to watching this movie is to just roll with it and not overanalyze it. It’s not an intellectual movie (nor is it trying to be) but it is, without a doubt, intelligently made. The production team’s thoughtfulness and attention to detail are hidden in plain sight (clever camera work, intense soundtrack, practical effects). Given how much is going on in this movie and the breakneck speed that it’s going at, it easily could’ve been a mess. But the attention to detail and pre-production preparation render it a cohesive, entertaining, and surprisingly tasteful piece of art and technical prowess.
